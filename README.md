Abstract:

> <p align="justify">This study contributes to an ex ante moral hazard empirical study on the National Health System (JKN) in Indonesia. The purpose of this study is to see the relationship between JKN ownership and risky health behaviours. Risk health behaviour represented using physical activity and smoking habits. The method used is a probit panel for dummy variables of physical activity, a Tobit panel and FEM for smoking habits variables. The results show that having the JKN Program reduces the individual's probability of doing physical activity by 2.5%, the reduction in the intensity of the individual doing physical activity. Still, there is no strong positive relationship to the distribution of individual cigarettes which are smokers. Although there are indications of ex ante moral hazard in the JKN program, the magnitude of the relationship is small, and there is no strong relationship with smoking behaviour. So that the current ex ante moral hazard does not become one of the issues that could disrupt the sustainability of the JKN program </p>
